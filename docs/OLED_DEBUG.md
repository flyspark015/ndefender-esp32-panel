# OLED Debug Display

The OLED is used only as a lightweight debug screen. Firmware must continue operating if the OLED is missing or fails to initialize.

Planned content:
- Boot banner (firmware version + build time)
- Serial link status (last RX/TX age)
- Current mode (IDLE / SCAN / LOCK / MANUAL)
- Selected video channel
- VRX1/2/3 frequency + RSSI
- Last command name + ok/fail
